Smart Rockets Genetic Algorithm Implementation (v2)
Welcome to the Smart Rockets Genetic Algorithm Implementation repository (v2)! This project is a Python implementation using Pygame, featuring a genetic algorithm for simulating smart rockets.

Overview
This repository is an updated version (v2) of a project initially created as a playful emulation of smart rockets using a genetic algorithm. The core functionality remains the same, but with improvements and better readability compared to the original version.

Features
Genetic Algorithm: Implements a genetic algorithm to evolve rockets towards a target.
Pygame Visualization: Visualizes the simulation using Pygame for interactive display.

Python 3.x
Pygame (install via pip install pygame)

Usage

Install dependencies (Pygame):

pip install pygame
Run the simulation:


python main.py

Watch as rockets evolve over generations to reach the target.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements or features, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.


Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the classic smart rockets genetic algorithm and is a fun way to explore evolutionary algorithms and simulation in Python.
