# Smart Rockets Genetic Algorithm Implementation trial v2

Welcome to the Smart Rockets Genetic Algorithm Implementation trial v2! This project is a Python implementation using Pygame, featuring a genetic algorithm for simulating smart rockets.

## Overview
This repository is an updated version (v2) of a project initially created as a playful emulation of smart rockets using a genetic algorithm. The core functionality remains nearly the same, but with changes in the how rockets behave they can now move freely in 2D space this version also has some improvements and better readability compared to the original version.

## Features
- Genetic Algorithm: Implements a genetic algorithm to tech rockets to reach a goal by trial and error
- Pygame Visualization: Visualizes the simulation using Pygame for interactive display.


## Dependencies
Python 3.11
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) (install via pip install pygame)

## How to use :

1. Install dependencies (Pygame) using the command :  pip install pygame
2. Run the simulation
3. Watch and enjoy as rockets evolve over generations to reach the target.

## code

## Comment
genetic algorithm is a fun way to explore evolutionary algorithms and it os fun to impilment it in python.
I hope you like my project ;)
